abstract = {It is now appreciated that cancers can be composed of multiple clonal subpopulations of cancer cells which differ among themselves in many properties, including karyotype, growth rate, ability to metastasize, immunological characteristics, production and expression of markers, and sensitivity to therapeutic modalities. Such tumor heterogeneity has been demonstrated in a wide variety of animal tumors of differing etiology, tissue and cellular origin, and species. It has been shown in autochthonous, as well as transplanted, tumors. Similar results have been reported for human cancers, although much of the evidence that heterogeneity of human cancers, also reflects, at least in part, the existence of clonal subpopulations, is still indirect. Heterogeneity is not a unique property of malignancy. Preneoplastic tumors, as well as normal tissues, are also composed of cellular subpopulations.},

abstract = {Cancer stem cells (CSC) were postulated to exist many years ago as cells within a tumor that regenerate the tumor following treatment. A stochastic clonal evolution model was used to explain observed tumor heterogeneity. Recently, xenotransplantation studies have demonstrated that prospectively identifiable subpopulations from human cancers can initiate tumors in immune deficient mice, and these results along with recent advances in stem cell biology have generated much excitement in the cancer field. The modern CSC theory posits a hierarchy of cells analogous to normal stem cell development. Some controversy remains, however, as to whether these tumor initiating cells truly represent CSC, and whether the modern CSC field can live up to the promise of providing improved cancer treatments based on a novel model of cancer biology. Recent data from CSC investigators are discussed critically.},

abstract = {The study of how cells interact to produce tissue development, homeostasis, or diseases was, until recently, almost purely experimental. Now, multi-cell computer simulation methods, ranging from relatively simple cellular automata to complex immersed-boundary and finite-element mechanistic models, allow . in silico study of multi-cell phenomena at the tissue scale based on biologically observed cell behaviors and interactions such as movement, adhesion, growth, death, mitosis, secretion of chemicals, chemotaxis, etc. This tutorial introduces the lattice-based Glazier-Graner-Hogeweg (GGH) Monte Carlo multi-cell modeling and the open-source GGH-based CompuCell3D simulation environment that allows rapid and intuitive modeling and simulation of cellular and multi-cellular behaviors in the context of tissue formation and subsequent dynamics. We also present a walkthrough of four biological models and their associated simulations that demonstrate the capabilities of the GGH and CompuCell3D. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Nowell1976,
abstract = {It is proposed that most neoplasms arise from a single cell of origin, and tumor progression results from acquired genetic variability within the original clone allowing sequential selection of more aggressive sublines. Tumor cell populations are apparently more genetically unstable than normal cells, perhaps from activation of specific gene loci in the neoplasm, continued presence of carcinogen, or even nutritional deficiencies within the tumor. The acquired genetic insta0ility and associated selection process, most readily recognized cytogenetically, results in advanced human malignancies being highly individual karyotypically and biologically. Hence, each patient's cancer may require individual specific therapy, and even this may be thwarted by emergence of a genetically variant subline resistant to the treatment. More research should be directed toward understanding and controlling the evolutionary process in tumors before it reaches the late stage usually seen in clinical cancer.},

@article{Demicheli2008,
abstract = {A few clinical investigations suggest that while primary breast cancer surgical removal favorably modifies the natural history for some patients, it may also hasten the metastatic development for others. The concepts underlying this disease paradigm, i.e. tumor homeostasis, tumor dormancy and surgery-driven enhancement of metastasis development, have a long history that is reviewed. The review reveals the context in which these concepts were conceived and structured to explain experimental data and shows that they are not so new and far fetched. The idea that surgical cancer resection has both beneficial and adverse effects upon cancer spread and growth that result from the modulation of tumor dormancy by the resection should be considered a potentially fruitful working hypothesis.},

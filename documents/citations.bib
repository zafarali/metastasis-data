abstract = {A few clinical investigations suggest that while primary breast cancer surgical removal favorably modifies the natural history for some patients, it may also hasten the metastatic development for others. The concepts underlying this disease paradigm, i.e. tumor homeostasis, tumor dormancy and surgery-driven enhancement of metastasis development, have a long history that is reviewed. The review reveals the context in which these concepts were conceived and structured to explain experimental data and shows that they are not so new and far fetched. The idea that surgical cancer resection has both beneficial and adverse effects upon cancer spread and growth that result from the modulation of tumor dormancy by the resection should be considered a potentially fruitful working hypothesis.},

abstract = {The study of how cells interact to produce tissue development, homeostasis, or diseases was, until recently, almost purely experimental. Now, multi-cell computer simulation methods, ranging from relatively simple cellular automata to complex immersed-boundary and finite-element mechanistic models, allow . in silico study of multi-cell phenomena at the tissue scale based on biologically observed cell behaviors and interactions such as movement, adhesion, growth, death, mitosis, secretion of chemicals, chemotaxis, etc. This tutorial introduces the lattice-based Glazier-Graner-Hogeweg (GGH) Monte Carlo multi-cell modeling and the open-source GGH-based CompuCell3D simulation environment that allows rapid and intuitive modeling and simulation of cellular and multi-cellular behaviors in the context of tissue formation and subsequent dynamics. We also present a walkthrough of four biological models and their associated simulations that demonstrate the capabilities of the GGH and CompuCell3D. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},
